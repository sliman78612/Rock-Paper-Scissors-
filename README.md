# Rock-Paper-Scissors

A game of rock paper scissors where the uesr will play against the computer. The user uses the webcam which the computer translates the informaiton using a model into rock, paper or scissors. 

## Creating the model 

I created the models using https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/. Here I created 4 classes where I used my webcam to take continuous images to in order to train the model.
